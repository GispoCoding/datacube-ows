Colour-Ramp Styles
------------------

Colour-ramp Styles are `styles<cfg_styling.rst>`_ where
a single continuous index value is calculated from the raw data for
each pixel, and that index value is mapped to a graduated colour ramp
for display.

Colour-ramp styles support the
`elements common to all styles<cfg_styling.rst#common-elements>`_.
